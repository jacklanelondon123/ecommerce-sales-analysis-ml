# 📊 Tableau Project — E-commerce Sales Analysis

This README explains my **Tableau visual analysis**, which continues from the Python data cleaning and RFM segmentation work in my main project.  
It shows how the insights from Python were transformed into clear, interactive Tableau dashboards.

## 🧹 Dataset Used

Two files were used in Tableau:

- **`online_retail_cleaned.csv`** → cleaned sales data for trends, countries, and products  
- **`online_retail_rfm.csv`** → RFM segmentation data for customer analysis  

Both datasets were exported from the Jupyter Notebook file:  
`Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`.
