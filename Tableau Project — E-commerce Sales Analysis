# 📊 Tableau Project — E-commerce Sales Analysis

This README explains my **Tableau visual analysis**, which continues from the Python data cleaning and RFM segmentation work in my main project.  
It shows how the insights from Python were turned into clear, interactive visuals.

## 🧹 Dataset Used
Two files were used in Tableau:

- **`online_retail_cleaned.csv`** → cleaned sales data for trend, countries, and products charts  
- **`online_retail_rfm.csv`** → RFM segmentation data for customer segment analysis  

Both were exported from the Jupyter notebook (`Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`).
